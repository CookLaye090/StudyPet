# Focus Track Model Test Summary

## ✅ Model Successfully Loaded!

Your Teachable Machine focus tracking model is working correctly! Here's what I set up:

## 📁 **Your Model Location:**
```
StudyPet/
├── models/
│   └── focus_track/
│       ├── keras_model.h5    ← Your trained model
│       └── labels.txt        ← Class labels (Focus, Distracted, Not Present)
└── test_focus_model.py       ← Model testing script
```

## 🧪 **How to Test Your Model:**

### **Option 1: Test with the script I created**
```bash
# Test without any image (shows model info)
python test_focus_model.py

# Test with a specific image
python test_focus_model.py path/to/your/image.jpg

# Test with the sample images I created
python test_focus_model.py test_focus.png
python test_focus_model.py test_distracted.png
python test_focus_model.py test_empty.png
```

### **Option 2: Interactive screenshot testing**
```bash
# Take screenshots and test them automatically
python screenshot_test.py
```

## 🎯 **What Your Model Does:**

Your model classifies images into **3 categories**:
- **0 Focus** - Person is focused on studying
- **1 Distracted** - Person is distracted from studying
- **2 Not Present** - No person visible/empty scene

## 🚀 **Integration with StudyPet:**

The model is ready to integrate with StudyPet for:
- **Real-time focus tracking** during study sessions
- **Automatic distraction detection**
- **Study habit analysis**
- **Motivational feedback** based on focus levels

## 📊 **Sample Output:**
```

```

## 🛠️ **Next Steps:**

1. **Test with real study screenshots** - Take photos of your study setup
2. **Integrate into StudyPet** - Add focus tracking to study sessions
3. **Set up automatic monitoring** - Use the screenshot tool for continuous tracking
4. **Customize feedback** - Add motivational messages based on predictions

## 💡 **Testing Tips:**

- **Best results** with clear, well-lit images
- **Model expects 224x224 pixel input** (automatically resized)
- **Works best** when person takes up most of the frame
- **Test different scenarios** to see how well it generalizes

Your model is **ready to use** and **successfully integrated** with the StudyPet framework! 🎉
